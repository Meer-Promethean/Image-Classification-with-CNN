# Image Classification with CNN

## Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to train and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the [Intel Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/data). The dataset contains images categorized into six classes: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street.

## Instructions:
1. Download the dataset from [Intel Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/data) and explore its structure.
2. Set up your environment with the necessary libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc.).

### Model Building
4. **Designing the CNN**:
   - Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the task. Describe the architecture of your model (number of layers, types of layers, activation functions, etc.).
   - Why did you choose this architecture?

5. **Loss Function and Optimizer**:
   - Which loss function and optimizer did you use? Justify your choices.

### Training the Model
6. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Specify the percentage of each split.
   - Train your model using the training dataset. Plot the training and validation accuracy/loss curves. What do these curves tell you?

### Evaluation and Results
8. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate your model on the test dataset. Report metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
9. **Visualizing Predictions**:
   - Visualize some correctly classified and misclassified images. What do you observe about these predictions?
